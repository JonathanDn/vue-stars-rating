# Usage
Install via NPM ```npm i vue-dynamic-star-rating```

Then require in your project:
```js
var StarRating = require('vue-dynamic-star-rating');
```
or ES6 syntax:
```js
import StarRating from 'vue-dynamic-star-rating'
```
Then you can register the component globally:
```js
Vue.component('star-rating', StarRating);
```
Or in your Vue component:
```js
components: {
  StarRating
}
```
You can then use the following selector anywhere in your project:
* To get up and running quick the package now supports rendering just the selector with default values
```html
<star-rating></star-rating>
```

# Props

## Basics

| Property | Type  | Description | Default

| **rating** | Number  | A number between 0.0-5.0 that will determine the fullness of the 5-stars rating polygons | 0 |
| **indicator** | Boolean | A property that deteremines weather a rating indicator would show to the right | false |

## Customized Styling

| Property | Type  | Description | Default |
| --- | ---  | --- | --- |
| **color.full** | string | Set the full or partially-full star color | ```#ed8a19``` |
| **color.empty** | string | Set the empty or partially-empty star color | ```#737373``` |
| **size** | number | Set the star width and height | 24 |

## Implementation Example
Define your **config** options object in the component importing StarRating e.g

data() {
  return {
    rating: 4.7,
    color: {
      full: '#FFDE2B',
      empty: '#3c455c',
    },
  }
}
```
And bind it to the selector like so
```html
<star-rating :rating="rating" :color="color"></star-rating>
```
